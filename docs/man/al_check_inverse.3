int\ al_check_inverse(const\ ALLEGRO_TRANSFORM\ *trans,\ float\ tol)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Checks if the transformation has an inverse using the supplied
tolerance.
Tolerance should be a small value between 0 and 1, with 0.001 being
sufficient for most applications.
Note that this check is superfluous most of the time if you never
touched the transformation matrix values yourself.
The only thing that would cause the transformation to not have an
inverse is if you applied a 0 (or very small) scale to the
transformation.
As long as the scale is comfortably above 0, the transformation
will be invertible.
